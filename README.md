# WorkForce-Elite - Java MySQL Project

## Overview

**WorkForce-Elite** is a Java application that manages employee records using a MySQL database. This project includes features for adding, updating, showing, and deleting employee records, as well as viewing employee details based on ID.

## Features

- **Add Employee**: Insert new employee records with ID, name, salary, and age.
- **Show All Employees**: Display a list of all employees with their details.
- **Show Employee by ID**: Retrieve and display details of a specific employee using their ID.
- **Update Employee**: Modify employee details including name, salary, and age.
- **Delete Employee**: Remove an employee record based on their ID.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 8 or later**: Ensure you have JDK installed on your system.
- **MySQL**: You need a MySQL database server running. Create a database and table for the project.
- **MySQL Connector/J**: Include the MySQL JDBC driver in your project dependencies.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/WorkForce-Elite.git
   cd WorkForce-Elite
   ```

2. **Database Setup**

   - Create a database named `workforce_elite` in MySQL.
   - Use the following SQL commands to create the `employee` table:

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE employee (
         id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         salary DOUBLE NOT NULL,
         age INT NOT NULL
     );
     ```

3. **Configure Database Connection**

   - Modify the `DBConnection` class to include your database connection details (e.g., URL, username, and password).

4. **Build and Run**

   - Use your IDE to build and run the project.
   - You can also use Maven or Gradle if configured.

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**
   - Run the `Main` class to start the application.
